    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Depending on how you are serving your shrimp, you can leave the shells on or 
            off. I peel and devein first and keep the shells for the shrimp boil.</li>

            garlic salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and bay leaf. Add 8 cups water and bring 
            to a boil over med/high heat.</li>
        <li>Once water boils, add the peeled and deveined shrimp and simmer until 
            pink, about 2-3 minutes depending on size of the shrimp. Drain and 
            transfer cooked shrimp to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process 
            and let cool.</li>
